# Extractors

Tremor script includes the functionality of extractors. Extractors are builtin tools that allow the user to extract various fields from the data based on patterns by providing different operations.  These extractors can be used by using the `~=` (called tilde operator) followed by the name of the extractor, the `|` operator and the pattern if required.
